## Goal
The purpose of this project is similar to the old game "telephone". Eventually after enough people put their own unique touch on the site, it will become something great. So what are you waiting for, let's get coding!

## Tests

### Locally

Run the test suite locally with the `rspec` command. You can specifiy specific
files to run with this command as well when you're working on a signle feature.
You should run the full suite before pushing changes to Github.

### CircleCI

We're using CircleCI for our continuous integration. This will automatically run
our tests when we push new changes to any branch.

## Contributing

EVERYONE is encouraged to contribute, after all, this is a project rooted on contributing! However, please be mindful of the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) file, which contains guidelines for submitting code.
